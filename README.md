## ✨ My Coding Journey

It all began when I was in **11th grade**, almost 3 years ago. Back then, coding was just a curious experiment for me. Little did I know, it would turn into a passion that would shape my future. Fast forward to today, I'm in my **2nd year of engineering**, diving deep into the world of technology and innovation.

From writing my first "Hello, World!" program to now tackling complex algorithms and developing projects, every step has been a thrilling adventure. I believe in learning by doing, and every line of code I write is a step toward becoming the software engineer I aspire to be.
